# Husky-Wolf-Binary-Classifier

## **Project Overview**
This project is a **binary image classification task** that aims to distinguish between **huskies** and **wolves** using **machine learning** techniques. We have developed a classification pipeline that processes images of varying sizes and predicts whether an image depicts a husky or a wolf.

## **Features**
- Load and preprocess dataset images.
- Train a classifier using **Logistic Regression** or a **Neural Network MLP**.
- Apply **data augmentation** techniques to improve model generalization.
- Evaluate model performance with **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Use **Grad-CAM** for model explainability and detect **data leakage**.
